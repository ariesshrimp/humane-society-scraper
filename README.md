# Oregon Humane Society Scraper

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/joefraley/humane-society-scraper.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
An automated node script for serializing info from the Oregon Humane Society's animals into well-structured data.
Currently this data is dumped into a Firebase store: https://humane-society-scrape.firebaseio.com/.

This is then consumed by my [Oregon Humane Society GraphQL API](https://github.com/joefraley/humane-society-api).
